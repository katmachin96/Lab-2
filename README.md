# Lab2

## Project Description

<!-- you can include known bugs, design decisions, external references used... -->

In this lab, we used CSS and HTML to style the webpage and JavaScript to do all the calculations so that the 
page could be updated dynamically. 

We use error checking in JavaScript to check that the inputs are valid and then check that the inputs can form 
a triangle. We factor out the code into different functions that calculate the various properties of the triangle. 

We take into account accessibility requirements by scaling the text dynamically and use skip links and a logical page hierarchy. 

Known Bugs: N/A
